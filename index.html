    <h1>Education and Income</h1>
    <h2>By Nick M, Jackson T, Harrison P</h2>
    
    <p>This contains a summary of the Final Project for DS 201. For more in-depth in-sight, please check out our walkthrough video or run our notebook directly in Google Colab linked below.</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>As data science students, we often look to data as a tool to illuminate persistent inequalities and uncover meaningful patterns that shape our society. In the United States, the connection between education and economic prosperity is frequently assumed to be direct and causal. Higher levels of education are believed to lead to higher incomes, better employment opportunities, and improved quality of life. But is this relationship as straightforward as it seems?</p>
    
    <p>The U.S. education system is vast and varied, with counties across the country showing significant differences in degree attainment. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, educational attainment is one of the strongest predictors of economic mobility, but disparities in access to quality education remain a pressing issue. Rural counties, in particular, often face systemic barriers to both higher education and high-paying jobs. Understanding how education levels correlate with income at the county level is essential to evaluating the effectiveness of education policy and identifying communities that may be underserved.</p>
    
    <p>At the same time, it is important to recognize that income is shaped by more than just education. Local industries, cost of living, historical inequality, and regional infrastructure also play key roles. While one county may see high earnings with modest degree attainment due to a dominant industry, another may struggle economically despite high educational levels. This complexity raises an important question: How strongly does educational attainment, specifically the percentage of residents with associate or bachelor's degrees, predict per capita income across U.S. counties?</p>
    
    <p>To explore this, we analyzed a dataset that includes income data from 2019 to 2021 and education statistics spanning from 2015 to 2020. By comparing these variables across hundreds of U.S. counties, we aim to assess whether patterns exist that can help explain economic outcomes through the lens of higher education. While this study is limited to quantitative correlations, it can serve as a starting point for understanding how educational investment might influence local economies and where such investment may have the greatest impact.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, <strong>our goal is to test whether increasing educational attainment aligns with increased personal income</strong> and to consider what this relationship implies for regional policy, resource allocation, and long-term economic development in the United States.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Organization</h2>
    
    <p>Our dataset merges county-level income and education statistics from two primary sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It includes over 3,000 U.S. counties and focuses on recent data spanning 2015 to 2021.</p>
    
    <p>The income data, sourced from the BEA (November 2022 release), includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>per_capita_personal_income_2019</li>
        <li>per_capita_personal_income_2020</li>
        <li>per_capita_personal_income_2021</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These figures represent average income per person in each county, incorporating wages, investment returns, and government transfers.</p>
    
    <p>The education data, from the USDA County-Level Dataset, includes both counts and percentages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>associate_degree_numbers_2016_2020</li>
        <li>bachelor_degree_numbers_2016_2020</li>
        <li>associate_degree_percentage_2016_2020</li>
        <li>bachelor_degree_percentage_2015_2019</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This dataset provides both the total number and the percentage of county residents who earned associate and bachelor's degrees over specified time periods.</p>
    
    <p>We also retained identifying information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>county_FIPS, state, county</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These columns identify the geographic location of each observation using the county's FIPS code, state name, and county name.</p>
    
    <p>These variables enable analysis of both absolute and relative educational attainment, allowing us to explore how income levels relate to education across different counties and regions. The multi-year averages smooth out short-term fluctuations and improve reliability. This structured dataset sets the foundation for statistical and spatial analysis of the link between economic prosperity and access to higher education.</p>
    
    <p>We started by reading the data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub and used the janitor package to clean and standardize column names. This is important to ensure consistent formatting for downstream analysis and modeling. We then created a variable summary table to document each feature's type (nominal, ratio) and a short description. This helps in understanding the dataset schema and planning which variables are suitable for modeling and visualization.</p>
    
    <h3>Variable Summary Table</h3>
    <img src="images/variable_summary_table.png" alt="Variable Summary Table">
    
    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
    
    <p>Here we explore some of the most interesting trends in our data. Please refer to our notebook to explore the findings in greater depth that helped answer our research question: How does education affect income at the county level in the United States?</p>
    
    <p>To quickly summarise our data set statistics we are showing key findings below:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dataset Overview</strong>: The dataset includes 10 columns: 3 nominal identifiers (county FIPS, state, county name) and 7 ratio-scale variables covering income and education metrics.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Income Distribution</strong>: Per capita personal income increased steadily from a mean of $45,947 in 2019 to $53,308 in 2021. Income is also right-skewed with a 2021 maximum of $318,297, indicating a few high-income counties disproportionately pulling up the average.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Education Statistics</strong>: Associate degree percentages range from a minimum of ~0% to a maximum over 80%, with a median around ~30%. Bachelor's degree percentages show an even wider spread, ranging up to nearly 76% in some counties, with a median around 33%. Raw degree counts vary massively—some counties have just a few hundred degree holders, while the largest counties exceed 1–2 million.</p>
    
    <p>These distributions reaffirm our earlier visual findings: education levels and income vary drastically across counties, setting the stage to analyze how tightly they are connected. To further visualize these statistics along with the missing values check, please refer to our notebook.</p>
    
    <h3>Income Growth Over Time</h3>
    
    <p>We first visualized how per capita income changed across 2019, 2020, and 2021 using boxplots to observe income distribution and trends over time, and to check for major economic shifts (e.g., pandemic impact). This helps contextualize education's effect on income by tracking whether changes in income are consistent over time.</p>
    
    <img src="images/distribution_income_byYear.png" alt="Distribution of Per Capita Income by Year">
    
    <p>This boxplot illustrates the distribution of per capita income across U.S. counties from 2019 to 2021. Across all three years, the distribution is right-skewed, with a small number of counties reporting very high incomes. While the overall shape remains consistent, there is a gradual increase in both the median and upper quartile values each year, indicating modest national income growth. These results establish a baseline for our analysis, helping us explore whether rising income levels are consistently linked to higher education attainment across counties.</p>
    
    <h3>Distributions of Education Level</h3>
    
    <p>We then plotted boxplots of associate and bachelor's degree percentages in order to understand how educational attainment is distributed across counties, which is foundational for correlating with income.</p>
    
    <img src="images/education_level_boxplot.png" alt="Education Level Distribution">
    
    <p>Associate degree attainment is generally higher and more consistent across counties, likely due to broader access through community colleges. In contrast, bachelor's degree attainment shows much wider variation—some counties have very low rates while others report extremely high percentages, reflecting structural disparities in access to four-year institutions.</p>
    
    <p>This contrast raises a key question: <strong>which level of education—associate or bachelor's—is more closely linked to income?</strong> If associate degrees correlate strongly with income, they may offer a more accessible path to economic growth. If bachelor's degrees show a stronger link, efforts to expand four-year degree access could have greater impact. To investigate, we next compare each degree type directly with income levels.</p>
    
    <h3>Education vs. Income</h3>
    
    <p>We created two scatter plots showing the relationship between Associate Degree % and Income (2021) as well as Bachelor's Degree % and Income (2021)</p>
    
    <p>Each included a linear regression trend line to visually assess the strength and direction of correlation between education level and income. A clear positive trend would suggest that higher education rates are associated with higher per capita income.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/assoc_deg_vs_income.png" alt="Associate Degree vs Income">
        <img src="images/bach_deg_vs_income.png" alt="Bachelor's Degree vs Income">
    </div>
    
    <p>This scatterplot explores the relationship between associate degree attainment and per capita income in 2021. The data show that while most counties have associate degree rates between 20% and 40%, income levels vary widely, with no clear upward trend. The flat regression line reinforces this observation—higher associate degree percentages do not consistently align with higher incomes. Though a few counties report exceptionally high income, they do not correspond to the highest associate degree rates, suggesting these outliers are influenced by other factors like local industry or advanced degrees.</p>
    
    <p>This weak correlation raises questions about the economic value of associate degrees at the county level. While associate degrees are more accessible and widely distributed, they may not deliver the same income boost as bachelor's degrees. These results suggest that associate-level education alone may not be a strong driver of income growth and underscore the need to examine how different levels of educational attainment contribute to economic outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>This scatterplot shows the relationship between bachelor's degree attainment and per capita income across U.S. counties in 2021. Compared to the previous chart on associate degrees, this graph reveals a much clearer positive correlation. As the percentage of residents with a bachelor's degree increases, per capita income tends to rise as well. The upward-sloping regression line confirms this trend, suggesting that counties with higher levels of four-year college attainment generally experience higher income levels.</p>
    
    <p>The spread of data is broader at higher education levels, reflecting greater variability in income among counties with more bachelor's degree holders. Still, the clustering of points along the trend line indicates a stronger and more consistent link between bachelor's degrees and economic prosperity. This pattern supports the hypothesis that bachelor's-level education plays a more direct role in boosting income, and underscores the potential value of policies that increase access to four-year degree programs.</p>
    
    <h3>Variable Correlation</h3>
    
    <p>We created a correlation matrix and heatmap for all numeric variables to quantitatively identify relationships between variables. This confirms whether our educational variables are significantly correlated with income, justifying their use in a predictive model.</p>
    
    <img src="images/correlation_plot.png" alt="Correlation Plot">
    
    <p>This scatterplot matrix provides a compact view of the relationships between per capita income (2021), associate degree percentage, and bachelor's degree percentage. The correlation values and scatterplots align closely with our previous findings.</p>
    
    <p>Most notably, there is a strong positive correlation (0.618) between bachelor's degree attainment and income, suggesting that counties with a higher share of bachelor's degree holders tend to have significantly higher per capita income. This supports our earlier observation that four-year degrees are a key driver of economic performance at the regional level.</p>
    
    <p>In contrast, the correlation between associate degree percentage and income is nearly flat at 0.024, reinforcing that associate degree attainment alone does not meaningfully predict higher income outcomes across counties. This finding is consistent with the weak trendline we observed in the associate degree scatterplot.</p>
    
    <p>An interesting secondary pattern is the slight negative correlation (-0.059) between associate and bachelor's degree percentages. This may indicate that counties tend to emphasize one form of postsecondary education over the other—either favoring technical/community college pathways or four-year university pipelines, but rarely both at high levels.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, this matrix helps confirm that while both degrees are common across the U.S., only bachelor's degree attainment shows a strong and consistent relationship with income, providing clear direction for policy and investment strategies.</p>
    
    <h3>Linear Assumption & Distribution Checks</h3>
    
    <p>Using ggpairs, we evaluated distributions, outliers, and pairwise relationships between key variables in order to visually assess assumptions for linear modeling, including normality and linear relationships. This ensures that data meets the assumptions required for linear regression to be valid.</p>
    
    <img src="images/clean_pair_plot.png" alt="Pairwise Comparison Plot">
    
    <p>Our research question assumes some form of relationship between education attainment and income. These findings reinforce what we saw from the correlation matrix allows us to see both correlation strength and distribution shapes, adding nuance to the findings. Regarding the Linear Assumption check, From the Per Capita Income 2021 vs. Bachelor's Degree % we see the scatterplot in the pair plot shows a clear upward trend, supporting a linear relationship. However, the Per Capita Income 2021 vs. Associate Degree % scatterplot appears random, with no clear trend. This suggests no linear relationship, and possibly no relationship at all. In terms of the Distribution Check, the diagonal plots show kernel density estimates (KDEs) for the distribution of each variable: Per Capita Income 2021 is Right-skewed, Associate Degree % is Symmetrical and almost normal, and Bachelor's Degree % is also right-skewed, but less so than income.</p>
    
    <h2>Training Machine Learning Model</h2>
    
    <p>EDA identifies missing values, outliers, or skewed data, but the data often still needs to be cleaned and preprocessed before it's used to train a model. To do this we started by preprocessing the model in order to clean the dataset by handling missing values. After this was complete we move into feature selection to clearly define input and output variables. We decided to define the target variable as per_capita_personal_income_2021 and used the other features as predictors. We then split data into 70% training and 30% testing sets to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on unseen data. We then did model evaluation to trains the statistical model to learn about the relationships. Please refer to our notebook/rmd file to see the code that was done for this. Below is the generated stats:</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Statistic</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Min</td>
            <td>-0.66056</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1st Quartile (1Q)</td>
            <td>-0.05052</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Median</td>
            <td>-0.00656</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3rd Quartile (3Q)</td>
            <td>0.03796</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Max</td>
            <td>1.59719</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>These values suggest that the residuals are relatively small (since the median residual is very close to zero) and there are no extreme outliers. The residuals range from -0.66 to 1.60, indicating that the model occasionally overestimates and underestimates the target variable, but these deviations are not excessively large.</p>
    
    <h3>Model Summary</h3>
    <p>Residual Standard Error: 0.1308 (on 2051 degrees of freedom)</p>
    <p>Multiple R-squared: 0.9846</p>
    <p>Adjusted R-squared: 0.9841</p>
    <p>F-statistic: 2421 on 54 and 2051 degrees of freedom</p>
    <p>p-value: < 2.2e-16</p>
    
    <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
    <p>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1227</p>
    <p>Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0732</p>
    <p>R-squared: 0.9815</p>
    
    <p>Overall, these metrics suggest that the linear regression model is performing well. The high R-squared and low RMSE/MAE values indicate that the model is accurate and that the predictors (such as associate degree percentage and bachelor's degree percentage) are strongly associated with per capita income. The adjusted R-squared suggests that the model has a high predictive power, which is crucial for making meaningful predictions about per capita income based on education levels and other predictors and the the F-statistic and p-value confirm that the model as a whole is statistically significant.</p>
    
    <p>The model shows that education level percentages (such as the percentage of people with an associate or bachelor's degree) are important factors in predicting per capita income in 2021. The model's high accuracy and low errors suggest that it can be used to make reliable predictions.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    
    <p>The goal of our analysis was to determine how educational attainment affects per capita income at the county level in the United States. We examined detailed data on income and education across over 3,000 counties, focusing on the percentages of residents with associate and bachelor's degrees. Based on our analysis, we found a clear and consistent pattern: bachelor's degree attainment shows a strong positive correlation with income, while associate degree attainment does not. Although both degrees are widely distributed, only bachelor's degrees appear to significantly predict higher economic outcomes. This pattern was confirmed through scatterplots, correlation matrices, and a well-performing linear regression model, which further showed that education variables—particularly bachelor's degree percentages—are important predictors of per capita income. While education is not the only factor influencing income, our findings support the view that expanding access to four-year degrees may be an effective strategy for boosting local economic well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>Main Observations</h2>
    
    <p>Firstly, we observed that per capita income increased modestly from 2019 to 2021, with income distribution showing a right-skewed pattern across all three years. At the same time, education levels varied widely. Associate degree attainment was relatively consistent across counties, while bachelor's degree percentages showed greater disparity—some counties had fewer than 10% of residents with bachelor's degrees, while others exceeded 70%. When we plotted these variables against income, associate degree percentages showed little to no correlation, while bachelor's degrees showed a strong and linear positive relationship. This trend was reinforced by a correlation of 0.618 between bachelor's degree percentage and income, compared to just 0.024 for associate degrees. Our modeling results supported these findings: the linear regression model had a high R-squared of 0.98, indicating that our predictors (including education) explain most of the variation in income. Additionally, we noted a small negative correlation between associate and bachelor's degree percentages, suggesting that counties may lean toward one educational pathway over the other.</p>
    
    <h2>Actionable Steps</h2>
    
    <p>Based on our findings, we propose several recommendations for policymakers, educators, and organizations interested in improving economic outcomes through education. First, efforts should be directed toward expanding access to bachelor's degree programs in counties with low attainment rates. Philanthropic investments, state funding, and public-private partnerships could support the development of satellite campuses, online degree options, and financial aid programs targeted at underserved regions. Second, increasing the number of transfer opportunities from community colleges to four-year institutions could help bridge the gap for students who begin with associate degrees but aim for bachelor's completion. Third, while our analysis focused on quantitative data, future research could benefit from integrating qualitative data—such as student experiences, barriers to enrollment, or perceptions of degree value—to better understand the human factors behind these trends. Finally, exploring the role of other education levels (e.g., master's degrees, trade certifications) could reveal alternative routes to economic growth in counties where four-year degree access remains limited. These strategies could help inform data-driven decisions around education funding and workforce development.</p>
